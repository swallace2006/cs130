Are more car accidents caused by distracted driving or driving under the influence of alcohol? To answer this question, the data column containing the perecentage of distracted drivers involved in car accidents accross each state can be averaged by taking the sum of the data and dividing it by the length. The same thing can be done with the data containing the impaired drivers, and the averages can be compaired.  Does this result vary throughout different regions of the country? A similar process can be used by calculating the average of distracted and drunk driving accidencts with slices of the the data sets that separate the states by mountain, pacific, central, and eastern time. What type of accident has the highest percentage of drivers in the state with the most expensive car insurance?
